This repository contains my bachelor thesis: source code and thesis paper.

Now, my bachelor thesis is in progress. If you have any improvement opinion and suggestion, please send me issues, thanks.

## Related Fields
I am plan to combine the following fields into my bachelor thesis:

* Human Computer Interaction
* Machine Learning
* Computer Vision
* Mobile Application Development
* Distributed Communications

## Prior Work
My prior works while undergraduates contains the following demonstrate system: 
* Mid-air gesture recognition through single RGB camera based on OpenCV and MFC;
* Solar system based on OpenGL-GLUT;
* Training Language compiler;
* Desktop computer automatic wakeup;
* Keynote remote controller via smart watches based on Node.js;
* Notification pushing based on LBS and iBeacon;
* Hand posture prediction based on touch behaviour and device motion;
* User authentication based on touch behaviour and device motion.

## Prior Frameworks
I developed the following frameworks when I was junior student:
* A scikit-learn style machine learning frameworks;
* A deep neural networks differential calculation toolkit;
* A distribution communication frameworks improve MPI Allreduce and Broadcast can be tolerance;

# Written Thesis Comments from Prof.Butz

## Abstract
The abstract is relatively clear, with several english problems, but understandable.

## Chapter 1

### 1.1 HCI & Wearable Computing
The english is much better from here on!

### 1.2 subject significance
Do you have any sources or references for these claims?

### 1.3.1 gesture interaction
partially not understandable english

### 1.3.2 extension interaction
this part is hardly understandable due to the english. what does "Stickiness" mean here?

## Chapter 2

### 2.1.1 tap
good argument, poor english.

### 2.2.1 digital crown
Apple did not invent the mouse or the multitouch screen. Sony used jog dials over a decade ago.

### 2.3.2 voice control
This analysis of the existing interactions with the apple watch is OK. The english is not perfect, but mostly understandable

## Chapter 3

### 3.2 completeness of alternative design
1. This image and the text in it is too small for reading when printed.
2. This just describes, what you chose as an alternative design, not why. Are there any good mappings that provide a good mental model?

A complete model is a prerequisite, but it is inly useful if the user can remember is, since it also provides no affordances!

In the bibliography, you cite several elicitation studies. This would have been the appropriate thing to do here.

## Chapter 4

### 4.1.2 watchOS & WatchConnectivity
This is too much technical detail without prior warning. It is not understandable to a general audience. Either you fully introduce the SW architecture of Apple Watch and iOS or you cat out both and just say there is an interactive and a delayed, non-blocking mode.

### 4.2.1 communication structure
OK, now it becomes clear what you meant before...

## Chapter 5

### 5.2.2 two fingers swipe
oops, figure ??

### 5.3.2 communication layer
The implementation section is quite clear and detailed, perfectly fine for a bechelor's thesis!

## Chapter 6

### 6.2 participants
1. This is too simple! Of course, you can take any number of users...
2. This justification for the number of participants is totally confusing. You do not even use eye tracking, right?? Your choice, 21 praticipants, however, seems reasonable.

### 6.3.2 social acceptable
This is not a statistical evaluation of the study. It just makes a statement about the test group, but gives to hints to generalizability, as for example a significance test would.

### 6.3.4 gesture intuition
Now, this is finally something interesting: can users understand and remember your gestures?
However, the graphics is not well explained. What do the numbers mean??

### 6.4 conclusions
1. No, you cannot conclude this! You did not do a proper statistical analysis, and the way in which you asked your questions in the study, also doesn't allow a proper statistical evaluation at all. In order to get generalizable results, you would have to compare two conditions, for example, your gestures against the state of the art, and then see which one gets the better ratings and whether this difference is significant. please read up about user studies!
2. This conclusion is plainly wrong. it does not follow from your study.

## Chapter 7

### 7.1.2 interaction related
Again, this is plainly wrong. In principle, you had a good idea here, but the values for the various T need to be measured empirically before you can use them, not only assumed...

### 7.2.1 recognition approach
good and feasible idea.

### 7.3 closing
quite flowery closing statements, which repeats the unjustified statements from earlier on.

## References
All of these references lack the publisher (ACM, IEEE press etc..)
Chinese references in an english text should be the exception.
